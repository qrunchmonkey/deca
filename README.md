#Decasecond International

My entry into Ludum Dare #27. The theme was "10 Seconds".

===
Here at Decasecond International, we've been working to find new and exciting ways of wasting time for nearly 48 hours, and we are proud to present our latest time wasting technology to you, TODAY! 

WARNING: There's no save function in the Compo version. If you close the tab, you lose your save. Hopefully I'll have a version with save for the Jam. 

(Note: Requires Javascript, and a semi modern web browser, not IE)
